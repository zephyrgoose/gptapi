Best Practices for Cisco Device Configuration August 08, 2024 In recent incidents, CISA has seen malicious cyber actors acquire system configuration files by leveraging available protocols or software on devices, such as abusing the legacy Cisco Smart Install feature. CISA recommends organizations disable Smart Install and review NSA’sSmart Install Protocol Misuse advisoryandNetwork Infrastructure Security Guidefor configuration guidance.[Smart Install Protocol Misuse advisory](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Jul/16/2002157833/-1/-1/0/CSA-CISCO-SMART-INSTALL-PROTOCOL-MISUSE.PDF)[Network Infrastructure Security Guide](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Jun/15/2003018261/-1/-1/0/CTR_NSA_NETWORK_INFRASTRUCTURE_SECURITY_GUIDE_20220615.PDF)CISA also continues to see weak password types used on Cisco network devices. A Cisco password type is the type of algorithm used to secure a Cisco device’s password within a system configuration file. The use of weak password types enables password cracking attacks. Once access is gained a threat actor would be able to access system configuration files easily. Access to these configuration files and system passwords can enable malicious cyber actors to compromise victim networks. Organizations must ensure all passwords on network devices are stored using a sufficient level of protection. CISA recommends type 8 password protection for all Cisco devices to protect passwords within configuration files. Type 8 password protection is more secure than other password types and approved by NIST. CISA urges organizations to review NSA’sCisco Password Types: Best Practices guidefor more information and follow the best practices for securing administrator accounts and passwords:[Cisco Password Types: Best Practices guide](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Feb/17/2002940795/-1/-1/1/CSI_CISCO_PASSWORD_TYPES_BEST_PRACTICES_20220217.PDF)This product is provided subject to thisNotificationand thisPrivacy & Usepolicy.[Notification](https://www.cisa.gov/notification)[Privacy & Use](https://www.cisa.gov/privacy-policy)Please share your thoughts We recently updated our anonymousproduct survey; we’d welcome your feedback.[product survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2024/08/08/best-practices-cisco-device-configuration)Related Advisories

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2. RISK EVALUATION Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute CIP programming and configuration commands. 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS The following versions of ControlLogix, GuardLogix, and 1756 ControlLogix I/O Modules are affected: 3.2 Vulnerability Overview 3.2.1Unprotected Alternate Channel CWE-420[Unprotected Alternate Channel CWE-420](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/420.html)A vulnerability exists in the affected products that allows a threat actor to bypass the Trusted Slot feature in a ControlLogix controller. If exploited on any affected module in a 1756 chassis, a threat actor could potentially execute CIP commands that modify user projects and/or device configuration on a Logix controller in the chassis. CVE-2024-6242has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H).[CVE-2024-6242](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2024-6242)[AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H)A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated forCVE-2024-6242.

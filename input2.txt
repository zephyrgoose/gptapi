CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:
 - Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they arenot accessible from the internet.
 - Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.
 - When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.
